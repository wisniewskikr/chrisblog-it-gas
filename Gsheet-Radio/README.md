DESCRIPTION
-----------

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to show how to work with radio buttons in Gsheet. 

##### Result 
User can select one message using radio button in Gsheet. Because there are not radion buttons in Gsheet then 
we had to use checkboxes with event listener - it enables only one checkbox selection in column. 
Then user can click on menu: Greeting -> Display Message. After this action selected message is displayed in dialog box.
